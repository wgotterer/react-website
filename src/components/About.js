        Originally from a small town in Massachusetts, I have shaped my life to be able to move around  and continuously learn from people throughout the world. For over five years I taught English and piano in Italy and Spain. 
        My passion for programming arose during the lockdown after discovering some free online courses. I quickly realized how familiar coding seemed. Itâ€™s a very similar process to learning Italian and Spain. Subsequently I took a full-stack software engineering bootcamp at The Flatiron school.
        With the skills I have harnessed over the years, I wish to use them to build connections, learn, and create for a better future.         </Typography>
